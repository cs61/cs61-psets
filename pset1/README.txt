NOTES FOR THE GRADER (if any):
"DO NOT GRADE"
-I'm a US Army soldier working in South Korea. We had UFG exercise + post exercise until Friday and unlike US Army soldiers, who could use their phones and laptops, I'm also affiliated to Korean Army and since Korean Army regulations don't allow us to use any devices, I couldn't access any of the material while I was in the field. But, please do not withdraw me from the course because until the end of the semester I don't have any more exercises and I think I can finish the assignment by getting penalties. (I have a computer that I can use in my office) I really need to take the course this semester. I apologize for the not submitting the assignment on time. I'll try my best. Thank you and have a gread day!.
